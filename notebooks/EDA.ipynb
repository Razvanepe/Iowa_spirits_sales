    "\n",
    "1. We will conduct Exploratory Data Analysis on what was **the impact of Covid-19 on the Alcoholic Beverages Industry**. We will take into consideration the demographic trans and Income per capita, but we will also make our recommendations and analysis considering the “regression to the mean” statistical principle.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We will also conduct **Storage Capacity** exploratory analysis with the purpose of predicting how the storage needs will change within one year from the current date.\n",

    "Later, in our next Notebook we will approach another Business problems that concerns the Alcoholic Beverages Division of Iowa:\n",

    "3. Cohort Analysis and **Customer Segmentation using RFM(Recency, Frequency and Monetary value) and Unsupervised Learning** in oru Pre-Processing section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, in our Modeling Part, we will focus on driving Business Insight to help a hypothetical liquor store owner make strategic decisions:\n",
    "\n",
    "4. We want to assist him in **expanding to new locations** throughout the state.\n",
    "5. Lastly, we want to use existing data for a **time series analysis and predictions to forecast sales for next month**."
